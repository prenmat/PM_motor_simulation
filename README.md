# PM_motor_simulation
Simulation of PM motor via Femm, approach FEMM-Matlab
This project is able to make a fast design of PM motor. The main target of this fast design is the torque, the others specifications can be tune up thanks to app Matlab.
In the end the main file can be used in different ways:
1. Simulation Fem in dynamics 
2. Manual optimization to improve the usage of the material
I have in mind to do some improvements:
1. Set the specific algorithm for trapezoidal slots
2. Create a Simulink sheet to set the control system to input the corrents to main function.
ENJOY IT.
